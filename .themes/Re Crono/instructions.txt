### HOW TO START ###

As you can see in my preview image I've added a custom panel. 
Gnome-panel unfortunately can't handle real transpareny without making it all look like a frellwit. 
We can work around this by embedding some graphics on our wallpaper, making it look like real transparency.

For this to work you need to have GIMP installed.
Ubuntu users - Open a terminal and type: sudo apt-get install gimp
Then you also need some plugins for gimp.
You also need a GIMP plugin call Liquid Rescale: sudo apt-get install gimp-plugin-registry

### THE IMAGE ###

1. Locate the panel.png file in this theme's directory.

2. Open the PNG-file in GIMP.

3. Go to Layer > Liquid Rescale.

4. Enter your screen resolution in the Width area and then resize the image. 
(The "chain" icon next to the values needs to be "open". If it's locked, just click on it. It should be open by default though.)

5. Press CTRL+A (or Select > All.) Copy the image and paste it on your wallpaper of choice. 
Important: Your wallpaper must have the same width and height as your desktop resolution.

6. Move the pasted layer to the top and then save your new wallpaper as whatever.png.

### THE PANEL ###

1. Go to the directory where you installed the theme. Open the panel.rc file.

2. Put a # in front of bg_pixmap[NORMAL] so it will look like this:
#bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = "/Panel/panel-bg.png" # Disable for normal panel backgrounds.
Then save the document.

3. Rightclick on your panel and select properties. Go to the Background tab and select Solid color. Move the Style slider all the way to the left.

4. And you're done! Enjoy your "faked transparent panel."
